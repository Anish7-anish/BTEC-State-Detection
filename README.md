# NCSU BTEC Water Treatment Facility Anomaly Detection System

Welcome to the repository for the advanced Python-based analytical tool developed for the water treatment facility at North Carolina State University's Biomanufacturing Training and Education Center (BTEC). This system utilizes a sophisticated LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network to monitor, detect anomalies, and manage states in time series data, ensuring the facility operates at peak efficiency and reliability.

## üöÄ Features

- **Secure Token Retrieval for GraphQL Authentication**: Ensures protected access to operational data, with robust security measures for data interactions.

- **Enhanced GraphQL Request Handling**: Manages GraphQL requests efficiently, ensuring seamless data fetching operations even with token expiration and re-authentication.

- **Data Preprocessing**: Readies incoming data for the LSTM model by normalizing it to maintain compatibility, enhancing the system's analysis capabilities.

- **Anomaly Detection with LSTM**: Leverages LSTM networks to pinpoint unusual patterns in time series data, signaling potential operational disruptions early.

- **Dynamic Thresholding for Anomaly Detection**: Utilizes dynamic thresholding to accurately detect deviations from historical trends, improving sensitivity to operational anomalies.

- **State Management**: Adjusts operational states dynamically between "normal" and "high usage" based on detected anomalies, allowing proactive resource management. Below is a visual example of state transitions within the system:

- **Visualization of Data and Anomalies**: Features intuitive graphical representations of time series data, anomalies, and state transitions, aiding in decision-making. Below is an example of how the system visualizes data:
